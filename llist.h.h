/* llist.h 
 * 
 * External (public) declarations for simple doubly-linked list in C.
 * 
 * This list will know head and tail, and will be capable of forward
 * and reverse iteration.  The tail node should always assign its next
 * pointer to NULL to indicate the end of the list, and likewise, the
 * head node should assign its previous pointer to NULL for the same
 * reason.
 * 
 * Note that the pop operations do not return a reference to the
 * popped node.  This would require storage for the node to be
 * released by the user, which could lead to memory mishandling.
 * The user will need to use head or tail pointers to interact with the
 * node prior to popping it.
 * 
 * This list will only hold strings (char arrays) for simplicity, and
 * will have ownership of the strings.  This means the string will
 * need to be copied into memory under control of the list.
 *

 *         Parameters:  myList - a pointer to the structure to be init
 *         Returns: void

 *         Parameters:  myList - the list
 *         Returns: int, size of list

 *     not NULL.  If it is NULL, this method should do nothing and
 *     make no changes to the list.  If it is not NULL, it can be
 *     assumed that it is a valid null-terminated string.
 *         Parameters:  myList - the list
 *                      toStore - the char array to store
 *         Returns: int - 0 if no push (toStore was NULL) or non-zero
 *                        if push successful

 *         Parameters:  myList - the list

 *                      toStore - the char array to store
