# DoublyLinkedList
This was the first lab for my operating systems class where we were tasked with creating a doubly linked list in C, in a Linux environment where all of the debugging and executing was from the terminal. The makefile script has also been attached and it is used as a way to have access to easy compilation and slight error checking before more intensive measures need to be done. Also, the program has been tested using the valgrind command to ensure that no memory leaks occur.
